Programmatically interact with [HaLo tags](https://arx.org/?source=gh) from the web browser, mobile application or the desktop.

## Installation

**Using NPM:**
```
npm install --save @arx-research/libhalo
```
**Using Yarn:**
```
yarn add @arx-research/libhalo
```

## Available APIs

The library exposes the following API functions:

### (Web browser) execHaloCmdWeb
```
async function execHaloCmdWeb(command, options)
```

For web browser applications: scan the HaLo tag presented to the smartphone, execute the
HaLo command and return the result. Supporting Chrome (Android), Safari (iOS) and other browsers.
Installation of additional software is not required on the user's side.

### (React Native) execHaloCmdRN
```
async function execHaloCmdRN(nfcManager, command, options)
```

For React Native mobile applications (Android/iOS) based on `react-native-nfc-manager` library: scan the HaLo tag presented to the smartphone, execute the HaLo command and return the result.

### (Desktop) execHaloCmdPCSC
```
async function execHaloCmdPCSC(command, reader)
```

For desktop applications based on `nfc-pcsc` library: scan the HaLo tag present at the specified `reader`, execute the HaLo command and return the result.

## Supported HaLo commands

This library supports the following HaLo tag commands:

* `sign` - sign arbitrary data using ECDSA private key on the NFC tag;
* `sign_random` - sign a sequential counter with random pad using ECDSA private key on the NFC tag;
* `write_latch` - write one-time programmable memory slot on the NFC tag;
* `cfg_ndef` - configure the parameters returned in the dynamic URL when the NFC tag is scanned;
* `gen_key` - request generation of the key #3 on the NFC tag;
* `gen_key_confirm` - confirm the generated public key of key slot #3;
* `get_pkeys` - get tag's public keys #1, #2 and #3;
* `version` - check HaLo tag's firmware version (only for PCSC/React Native);
* `read_ndef` - read the dynamic URL generated by the tag (only for PCSC/React Native);

## Additional tools

This project also features additional tools which could increase interoperability.

### HaLo Bridge
The Bridge could be used to locally interconnect the USB NFC reader directly with a web application. This allows to execute multiple HaLo commands against multiple tags very quickly.

Guides:
* [Using HaLo Bridge](https://github.com/arx-research/libhalo/blob/master/docs/halo-bridge.md)

### HaLo Gateway
The Gateway could allow to use a compatible web application on the desktop computer, but with your own smartphone instead of the card reader.
