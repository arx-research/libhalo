# HaLo Bridge

HaLo Bridge is a special tool dedicated for desktop computers. The tool is provided in a form of native program
for your platform (Windows, Linux, Mac OS). Once you launch HaLo Bridge, it will connect with your physical
USB NFC reader and expose it as a WebSocket Server.

In particular, it means that whenever you will have HaLo Bridge tool running on your computer, any authorized
website will be able to interact directly with your USB NFC reader in order to sign some information with HaLo
tags.
